            <article>
              <p>
                Sulina beach is a small, hidden gem on the Black Sea kind of a
                wild beach. Nights have few surprise too: beach bar parties,
                star gazing, swimming with illuminating plankton's.

              <p>
                K Island or Bird Island is another spectacular place that
                tourists want to visit. It is a tongue of land near Sulina, to
                which only birds have access. It was called K Island because it
                was originally shaped like the letter K.

                reed jungle, a sunrise on the water, hundreds of water birds are
                some things you can see in a half, entirely, or even more days.
